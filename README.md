# xbox_controller_process_freeze
A small example bash script that freezes and unfreezes processes when pressing the xbox button on xbox controllers.

The purpose of this project is (primarily) to assist in me with text lookup while using certain appplications for Japanese study and is designed to meet my specific use case, but this script can serve as a solid reference for people with similar use cases.

Dependencies:
`evtest`

Usage:
`./freeze_process.sh EVTEST_EVENT_CODE PROCESS_ID`
